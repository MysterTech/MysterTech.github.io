          Hi, Iâ€™m Matt. Nice to meet you. Since beginning my journey as a
          freelance designer nearly 10 years ago, I've done remote work for
          agencies, consulted for startups, and collaborated with talented
          people to create digital products for both business and consumer use.
          I'm quietly confident, naturally curious, and perpetually working on
          improving my chops one design problem at a time.
